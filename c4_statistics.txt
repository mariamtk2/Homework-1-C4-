After analyzing the c4.c file using Lizard, I obtained several key metrics regarding its structure and complexity:

1. Lines of Code (LOC)
The program consists of 642 non-commented lines of code (NLOC).
Individual functions have LOC ranging from 65 to 213.

2. Cyclomatic Complexity (CCN)
The highest complexity function is main, with a CCN of 100, indicating a high level of branching and decision-making.
Other functions also exhibit significant complexity such as next which has has 85, and expr which has 57.
These values suggest that the code may be difficult to maintain or refactor.

3. Number of Functions & Their Sizes
The program contains 4 functions.
Their sizes vary, with the largest function spanning 213 lines and the smallest at 65 lines.

4. Token Count
The total token count is 1256.5 on average per function, with main being the most complex at 2214 tokens.
A high token count indicates dense logic, potentially making the code harder to read and optimize.
Warnings Identified

Important to note that Lizard issued warnings due to high cyclomatic complexity (> 15) and large function sizes (> 1000 LOC).
These suggest potential maintainability and readability issues.
